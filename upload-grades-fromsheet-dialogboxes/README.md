# classroom-grade-upload-fromsheet

A simple google app-script to upload grades from google spreadsheet to google classroom assignment (the assignment must be created from app-script in order to have access, if the assignment does not exist, it creates one).

written for personal use in one of my course works and may include some serious bugs. So make sure to test it first on dummy data.
